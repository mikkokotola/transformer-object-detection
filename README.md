# Object Detection with Transformers
Project on end-to-end object detection with transformers for Advanced Deep Learning course at the University of Helsinki (11-12/2020)

## Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to 1) report on end-to-end object detection with transformers, comparing the approach to alternative object detection approaches; and 2) to implement the approach of the article and measure its performance. 

The topic is given by the main source article: Carion et al.: [End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12872.pdf).

In the implementation, we initially rely on the [article authors' source code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr). During the project, we may diverge from the sample implementation and document how and why we choose different ways to implement the approach.
