# Object Detection with Transformers
Project on end-to-end object detection with transformers for Advanced Deep Learning course at the University of Helsinki (11/2020-1/2021)

## Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to 1) report on end-to-end object detection with transformers, comparing the approach to alternative object detection approaches; and 2) to implement the approach of the article. 

The topic is given by the main source article: Carion et al.: [End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12872.pdf).

The final report is [here](ADL_report_transformer_object_detection.pdf).

The group's own implementation of DETR is in folders [notebooks](notebooks/) and [python](python/). 

As point of comparison, see the [article authors' source code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr). 

## Repository content
Subfolders:
- [notebooks](notebooks/) contains Jupyter notebooks (Python 3) for the project
- [python](python/) contains Python code used by notebooks
- [scripts](scripts/) contain bash scripts used to run the training on CSC Puhti environment
- [models](models/) contains a pretrained model
